      <p>I worked as a physical education teacher who taught fitness, nutrition, and health to children and adolescents. As a teacher, I knew I was passionate about fitness, wellness, nutrition, and empowering others to take control of their health. I then realized how I wanted to guide, empower, and support women and working mothers overcome any health challenge they face through natural healing and make it my purpose to guide them back to restorative, preventative, and balanced health inside and out.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;My holistic health packages are geared toward women&nbsp;who want increased energy, want to get fit and manage a healthy weight, want decreased stress, have a desire to eat healthier and fulfill their nutritional needs through fun, plant-based, easy to cook recipes. My goal is to empower those to finally live the fulfilling life he/she was meant to live.</p>
      <p>My practice emphasizes self-care practices for emotional and mental health, flexible, convenient fitness tips catered to one&rsquo;s fitness level, recipes and meal planning strategies that set one up for success, and resources, practices, and strategies that encompass disease &lsquo;prevention.&rsquo; After all, prevention IS the best medicine.</p>
      <p>Disease, cancer, and other disorders are on the rise in this country. Losing my mother to breast cancer in December of 2012 has fueled my purpose and passion to guide and support other women in healing and educating them on the importance of prevention. It is my belief that this can be accomplished through diet, fitness, rewiring of our body's system mentally and physically and overall environment, daily stress relief methods, healthy detox methods, balancing the body's ph levels/alkaline/acid balance, and integrating healthy lifestyle patterns in a holistic approach that work best for one&rsquo;s unique physical, emotional, social, and mental needs..</p>
      <blockquote>
        <h3><strong> &rdquo;We are all unique and require a specific level of nourishment and healing that caters specifically to our bioindividuality.&rdquo;</strong></h3>
      </blockquote>
      <p style="text-align: left;">&nbsp; &nbsp;After experiencing a few physical ailments on my own throughout my teenage years and early 20's such as acne, depression, anxiety, and sugar addiction, I was able to completely reverse and heal these ailments through simple dietary changes, exercise routines, and stress-relief methods alone without the use of prescription drugs or other conventional treatments. Other areas of focus in my health coaching program is geared toward strengthening reproductive health and digestive health.</p>
      <p style="text-align: left;">Perceptive Wellness Health Coaching emphasizes the way in which we can reach true well-being and nourishment through awareness of our lives as a "whole," and then sustaining balance and restoration comes into play.&nbsp;</p>
      <p>I received my training from the&nbsp;<a href="http://www.integrativenutrition.com/">Institute for Integrative Nutrition</a>, where I was trained in more than one hundred dietary theories and studied a variety of practical lifestyle coaching methods. I am passionate about whole, plant-based foods and their role in disease prevention, physical and mental fitness, and coaching/guiding my clients in a way that works best for them.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;Pushing our own limits, challenging ourselves, and getting out of the "comfort zone box" is how I live. My quest is to help transform and inspire the lives of others to take the proper steps in achieving real "balance" in their life while making smart lifestyle choices to restore health and vitality.</p>
      <p>Drawing on this knowledge, I will create a completely personalized coaching approach that suits your unique body, lifestyle, preferences, and goals.</p>

I love each of them and hope they realize they have the power to change and continue to thrive!!!!! God is at work... Let's ignite that individual, unique healing power and ability your WHOLE body has and gaining the immune resilience, optimum health, and balance we are all meant to have!"</p>
